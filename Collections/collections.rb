# "The summer of tenth grade was the best summer of my life.  I went to the beach everyday and we had amazing weather.  The weather didnt really vary much and was always pretty hot although sometimes at night it would rain.  I didnt mind the rain because it would cool everything down and allow us to sleep peacefully.  Its amazing how much the weather affects your mood.  Who would have thought that I could write a whole essay just about the weather in tenth grade.  Its kind of amazing right?  Youd think for such an interesting person I might have more to say but you would be wrong"
 
# Count how many times each word appears in my story.
# Tip: You'll need to use Hash.new(0) to do this rather than creating a hash using literal syntax like {}.
